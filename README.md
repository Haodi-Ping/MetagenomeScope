## NOTE: MetagenomeScope is currently being refactored!
Some features that were previously in MetagenomeScope are not currently
re-implemented yet -- this should be changed soon. Thanks for bearing with me
as I work on improving this, and please let me know if you have any questions.

## Summary

MetagenomeScope is an interactive visualization tool designed for metagenomic
sequence assembly graphs. The tool aims to display a [hierarchical
layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layered_graph_drawing) of the input graph
while emphasizing the presence of small-scale details that can correspond to
interesting biological features in the data.

To this end, MetagenomeScope
highlights certain "structural patterns" of contigs in the graph (repeating the
pattern identification hierarchically),
splits the graph into its connected components (by default only displaying one
connected component at a time),
and uses [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/)'
[`dot`](https://www.graphviz.org/pdf/dotguide.pdf) tool to hierarchically
lay out each connected component of the graph.

MetagenomeScope also contains a bunch of other features intended to simplify
exploratory analysis of assembly graphs, including tools for scaffold
visualization, path finishing, and coloring nodes by biological metadata (e.g.
GC content). (As mentioned above, many of these features are not available in
the current version yet.)

MetagenomeScope is composed of two main components:

### 1. Preprocessing Script

MetagenomeScope's **preprocessing script** (contained in the
`metagenomescope/` directory of this repository) is a mostly-Python script that
takes as input an assembly graph file and produces a directory containing a
HTML visualization of the graph.

Once you've installed MetagenomeScope, running the preprocessing script is as
simple as

```bash
mgsc -i [input assembly graph file] -o [output directory name]
```

**Note.** By default, connected components containing 8,000 or more nodes or
edges will not be laid out. These thresholds are configurable using the
`--max-node-count` / `--max-edge-count` parameters. This default is intended
to save time and effort: hierarchical layout can take a really long time for
complex and/or large connected components, so oftentimes trying to visualize
the largest few components of a graph will take an intractable amount of
computational resources / time. Furthermore, really complex components of
assembly graphs can be hard to visualize meaningfully.

This isn't always the case (for example, a
connected component containing 10,000 nodes all in a straight line will be
much easier to lay out and visualize than a connected component
with 5,000 nodes and 20,000 edges), but we wanted to be conservative with the
defaults.

#### What types of assembly graphs can I use as input?

Currently, this supports
LastGraph ([Velvet](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/velvet/)),
[GFA](https://gfa-spec.github.io/GFA-spec/) (e.g.
[Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye)),
GML ([MetaCarvel](https://github.com/marbl/MetaCarvel)),
and FASTG ([SPAdes](https://cab.spbu.ru/software/spades/)) files.

### 2. Viewer Interface

MetagenomeScope's **viewer interface** (contained in the
`metagenomescope/support_files/` directory
of this repository) is a client-side web application that visualizes laid-out
assembly graphs using [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/).

This interface includes various features for interacting with the graph and the
identified structural patterns within it.

You should be able to load visualizations created by MetagenomeScope
in most modern web browsers (mobile browsers probably will also work, although
using a desktop browser is recommended).
