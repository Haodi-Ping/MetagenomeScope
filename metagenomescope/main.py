    # Immediate TODO:
    # -Compute graph layouts. For each component:
    #   -Lay out individual patterns, starting at lowest level and moving up.
    #    Similar to SPQR layout code.
    #   -Finally, lay out the entire graph for the component, with patterns
    #    replaced with their bounding box.
    #   -Backfill all node/edge coordinates in.
    #
    #   At this point we can create AssemblyGraph.to_dot(), to_cytoscape(),
    #   etc. methods for temporary testing.
    #
    # -Use jinja2 to pass data to the viewer index.html file.
    #
    # -Modify the JS to prepare the graph summary, etc. and get ready for
    #  component drawing. Replace DB operations with just looking at the JSON.

    # TODO from here on down.
    # -Identify user-supplied bubbles.
    # -Identify user-supplied misc. patterns.
    # -If -spqr passed, compute SPQR trees and record composition/structure.
    # -Output identified pattern info if -sp passed
    # -Identify connected components for the "single" graph (SPQR mode).
    # -Identify connected components for the "normal" graph (non-SPQR mode).
    # -Compute node scaling for each connected component
    # -Compute edge scaling for each connected component
    # -SPQR layout!
    # -Normal layout!
