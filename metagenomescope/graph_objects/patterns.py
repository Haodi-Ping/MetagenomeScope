        incoming/outgoing edges not in the simple cycle -- that is, this
        basically just looks for chains that end cyclically. (This also
        identifies single-node loops as cycles.)

        The ideal way to implement cycle detection in a graph is to use
        Depth-First Search (so, in our case, it would be to modify the
        code in collate.py that already runs DFS to identify cycles), but
        for now I think this more limited-in-scope method should work ok.
